# Jax

This is Jax, our mascot. And he is interested in seeing more outside comfort zone, so he has come to GitHub and see what you're up to! He is planning to hear about you and your ideas either for marketing, development, viral content, security concerns... You name it! He'll **watch you** carefully!
